In this project, we used AVR ATmega32, LEDs (Lamps), dimmer, DC motor (Air Conditioning), servo motor (Door), buzzer, keypad, LCD, Bluetooth module and EEPROM. The purpose of the projects is to create a software for smart homes that can be controlled remotely. The software has security system that tells the user first to enter their username and password. If he/she enters them incorrectly three time, the system is locked down and the buzzer rings. There are three types of users: Admin (Owner of the house) which have access to all functions and can create other users. there is only one admin and can’t be changed. Second user is Close-up user which has access only by the keypad and can’t control the servo motor (door). The third user is remote user which have access only by the mobile application.
